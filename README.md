# OptimizingSolarPanelPlacement
Solar Panel Placement Optimization

📌 Project Overview

This MATLAB-based project optimizes solar panel placement using GIS mapping, IoT sensor integration, and a smart tracking system to maximize solar energy efficiency. The system dynamically adjusts panel tilt based on real-time solar irradiance and environmental conditions.

🚀 Features Implemented

✅ GIS-Based Solar Panel Placement – Uses MATLAB's Mapping Toolbox to analyze terrain and irradiance.
✅ IoT Sensor Integration (Simulated) – Captures real-time solar irradiance & temperature data.
✅ Smart Tracking System – Dynamically adjusts panel tilt to maximize sun exposure.
✅ Shading & Sunlight Analysis – Identifies obstructions and optimizes placement to reduce shading losses.
✅ 3D Visualization – Displays solar irradiance and panel locations using MATLAB plots.

🛠 Technologies Used

MATLAB (Optimization Toolbox, Image Processing Toolbox, Mapping Toolbox)

IoT Sensors (Simulated) – Real-time environmental data monitoring.

GIS Mapping – Uses geospatial data for terrain analysis.

Smart Tracking System – Algorithm-driven dynamic tilt adjustments.
